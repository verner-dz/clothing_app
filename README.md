Common Fibers

Summary:
Did you know that there are only 2 manufacturers that make glasses? Or that there a handful of clothing manufacturers that sell to most of the high end brands?  
Common Fibers is a site where these suppliers can sell high end fashion merchandise directly to consumers in bulk. No more middle men (brands) charging 100x more just for slapping their logo on those items.

How it Works
- Supplier posts an item with a specific quantity.
- Consumers have to buy the whole inventory for the order to pass through.
- Once the order passes through, consumers get their orders fulfilled and shipped to them directly.
